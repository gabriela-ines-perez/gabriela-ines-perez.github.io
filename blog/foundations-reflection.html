    <h3>Reflecting on Core Learning during foundations
    </h3>
    <p>
      Throughout this course, I have been surprised by how relevant each aspect of core learning is to my growth as a learner and as a person. One aspect that surprised me was discovering my fixed mindset towards learning. Despite having a growth mindset in other areas of my life and being open to criticism and communication, I found myself nervous about feedback and fearful of falling behind others. However, acknowledging this mindset has allowed me to work on changing it and embrace a more growth-oriented approach to learning. This peaked on the week we were covering mindsets and Neuroplasticity in our core work- so excellent timing! 

    </p>
    <p>
      I have also realised that I have developed good problem-solving skills over the years I have been working. This has been a valuable skill that I can apply not only in my studies but also in various aspects of my life. In many ways I think like a programmer in other areas of my life and was pleasantly surprised to find it came quite easily to me. Another area of growth for me has been managing stress- I felt like I know what I had to do when things got tough. I have learned to use tools to manage my mental capacity better, which has been helpful in coping with the demands of the course and other stressors in my life.

    </p>
    <h3>The power of values and empathy in programming </h3>
    <p>
      I believe that values, empathy, and self-awareness are critical in programming and software development. When working in teams, having these qualities allows me to be a good team member and communicator, leading to happier teams and better outcomes. Moreover, given the power of technology to shape our world, it is essential to develop ethical applications that reflect our values and empathy towards others.  I think there is a lot of power in programming- even web development. Social media has changed the world and the way we experience our relationships, our self-image and mental health, and even the outcomes of elections. The software has the power to change the world. I believe the work we create should be done so with an understanding of software’s power in the world. Thus, I appreciate the focus on core learning in a school like Dev Academy.

    </p>
    <h3>I am still getting used to it</h3>
    <p>
      In saying all this, I must admit that I sometimes find myself resenting core learning (just a little bit) when I am under pressure or tasked with writing a blog which I don’t really enjoy doing. I suspect that this is due to an ingrained belief that the "fluffy" stuff is not as important. I am very impressed with how relevant and crucial it has been to learn- I have found this to have been very thoughtfully and intentionally woven into the technical work we do. In the past, I have found learning institutes and workplaces to include this sort of work in a very ‘tick-boxy’ type way so it’s refreshing to see it done so well. And much needed for me as a person. I look forward to continuing on this personal journey throughout Bootcamp.
