  <h3>What is EQ?</h3>
  <p> We’ve all probably heard of IQ and have different degrees of buy-in on whether or not it’s effective but have we heard of EQ? EQ is the ‘emotional quotient’ or the measure of emotional intelligence. It’s our ability to manage our own emotions and be aware of how they form and how they affect our lives and the people within them. They are often broken down into four keys skills: 
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Self-management</strong>- how can I control what I am feeling?</li>
      <li> <strong>Self-awareness</strong> why am I feeling this way, and how can I best deal with this situation?</li>
      <li> <strong>Social Awareness</strong>- how can I use empathy to understand the needs of others, pick up on cues or understand the impact of my actions on others?</li>
      <li> <strong>Relationship management</strong>- how do I work well in a team, manage conflict and foster good communication? </li>
    </ul>
    Mastering these skills is a way of increasing our emotional intelligence. 
  </p>

  <h3>EQ vs IQ</h3>
  <p>IQ or the ‘Intelligence Quotient’ is a measure of our ability to solve problems, learn and apply skills and use logic to accomplish challenging tasks. It’s usually determined with a standardised test and measured. EQ can be measured as well and is often determined by how well we understand and conduct ourselves and our relationships with others. They both have an important role to play, although society often favours IQ in theory it’s usually a higher EQ that allows people to flourish- even if their IQ is average.</p>

  <h3>Why worry about EQ anyway?</h3>
  <p>We are finally evolving to the point where we value emotional intelligence. A high EQ makes us more employable, improves our relationships and allows us to overcome personal and professional obstacles faster.  </p>
<p>Alain de Botton, argues that emotional intelligence is not an inherent ability that we are born with, but one we learn. Education is key to being able to interpret our own emotions, understand what factors in our lives affect them and how we interpret the emotions of others. There is also a valid criticism that we have not put enough emphasis on emotional intelligence and although we are rapidly advancing technologically, we have stunted our growth emotionally with ‘catastrophic’ results. </p>
<p>Emotional intelligence can tame and shape what we deem to be more traditional intelligence. We have built a society with a softer focus on EQ but if we were to weave it into each of our decisions, heavily intertwined with culture, maybe our advancements will occur without destroying our planet, marginalising communities, resorting to violence to resolve conflict or letting greed be the single most force that accelerates progress. </p>
<p>If we’re learning code to solve problems in the world, how can we understand those problems and what other people need (be it customers, users, members or our employers) if we don’t prioritise strengthening our EQ? </p>
