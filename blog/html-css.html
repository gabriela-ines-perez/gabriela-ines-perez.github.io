    <h3>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</em></h3>

  <div id="blog-text">
    <p>The best way for me to teach you, my little rubber duck, is for me to learn alongside you. Let's figure this out together! We are going to learn about the <strong><em>position</em></strong> property in css. I've previously used the <strong><em>display</em></strong> property with the value flexbox to position my blog posts and make them responsive. </p>
    <p>Look at that. Lovely. </p>
    <img src="../images/flexbox-desktop.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
    <p>Also, they stack on mobile using flex-wrap.  </p>
    <img src="../images/flexbox-mobile.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on mobile" class="image-resize-small">
<p>We love to see it</p>
<p>I breezed passed it, having now heard about flexbox and getting sucked right into the craze I thought it would solve all my position problems. What a fool I was. I didn't realise that position is it's own property. </p>
<br>
<h3>What is position in html/css?</h3>
<p>I have this issue with my home page. </p>
<p>I like the idea of having an overlapping tag above each blog post in the home page that identitifies it as a 'tech' or 'core' blog. I am sure once we start learning how to use conditional logic, these tags can be useful for filtering out content. </p>
<p>But for now I just want it to look good but, alas, this is how it currently looks:</p>
<img src="../images/initial-blog-box.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>This is what is happening behind the scenes:</p>
<p>This is the html</p>
<img src="../images/html-initial.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>This is the css</p>
<img src="../images/css-initial.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Seems like I need the child object (tag) to attach to the top right hand corner of the parent (blog-box) and overlap. What are my options for position? A quick google search tells me there are five main types of positions in CSS- <strong>Relative</strong>, <strong>Absolute</strong>, <strong>Sticky</strong>, <strong>Fixed</strong> and <strong>Static</strong>. We'll just focus on three since static is the default and sticky uses scroll and that is not going to help my tag problem.</p>
<p>First let's make the tag look nice, we can change the display to inline (now we know that display/position are different properties) and round those corners out a bit. </p>
<img src="../images/css-tag-refresh-all.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>and here are the results:</p>
<img src="../images/tag-refresh.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Nice.</p>
<br>
<h3>Relative</h3>
<p>The relative position is named as such because the position is relative to its normal self. You can offset a position by adjusting the  the top, bottom, left, and right properties.</p>
<p>Let's try it out!</p>
<img src="../images/css-relative-position.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Seems to do the trick!</p>
<img src="../images/relative-results.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>But what if I want to change the width of the parent object (blog-box) from 400px to 800px. </p>
<img src="../images/css-blog-blox-400px.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<img src="../images/css-blog-blox-800px.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Here's what it looks like.</p>
<img src="../images/blog-box-800px.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">

<p>That’s not ideal. Seems like the relative position might need to be adjusted every time. Time to try something else.  </p>
<br>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<p>This position is in relative to the viewport. Let's try it out. </p>
<img src="../images/css-fixed.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>What did that do?</p>
<img src="../images/fixed-scroll-1.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Let's have a quick scroll</p>
<img src="../images/fixed-scroll-2.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>It's still there.</p>
<img src="../images/fixed-scroll-3.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>Okay this won't do.</p>
<br>
<h3>Absolute</h3>
<p>An absolutely positioned element is relative to the nearest positioned parent. If none are positioned- it uses the body. So let's position the parent ‘blog-box' and set it to a relative position.</p>
<img src="../images/css-relative-parent.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Great now let's change the tags position to absolute:</p>
<img src="../images/css-absolute.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Let's see how it looks:</p>
<img src="../images/absolute-result.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Let's see what happens when I change size of the parent 'blog-box'.</p>
<img src="../images/absolute-800px.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Perfect.</p>
