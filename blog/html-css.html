    <h3>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</em></h3>
    <h4>6 April 2023</h4>

    <p>The best way for me to teach you, my little rubber duck, is for me to learn alongside you. Let's figure this out together! We are going to learn about the <strong><em>position</em></strong> property in css. I've previously used the <strong><em>display</em></strong> property with the value flexbox to position my blog posts and make them responsive. </p>
    <p>Look at that. Lovely. </p>

    <p>Also, they stack on mobile using flex-wrap.  </p>
    <img src="../images/flexbox-mobile.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on mobile" class="image-resize-small">
<p>We love to see it</p>
<p>But I just breezed passed it, having now heard about flexbox and getting sucked right in to the craze I thought it would solve all my position problems but I didn't bother about thinking of the idea of display vs position. </p>
<h3>What is position in html/css?</h3>
<p>Now I have this issue with this blog. </p>
<p>I like the idea to have a tag above each blog post in the home page that identitifies it as a 'tech' or 'core' blog. I am sure once we start learning how to use conditional logic and apply these, these tags can be useful for filtering out content. </p>
<p>But this is how it currently looks:</p>
<img src="../images/initial-blog-box.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>This is what is happening behind the scenes:</p>
<img src="../images/html-initial.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>This is the html</p>
<img src="../images/css-initial.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>This is the css</p>
<p>Seems like I need the child object (the tag) to attach to the top right hand corner of the parent (the blog box container). What are my options for position? A quick google search tells me there are five main types of positions in css- *Relative*, *Fixed*, *Absolute*, *Sticky* and *Static*. We'll just focus on three since static is the default and sticky because that uses scroll and that is not going to help my case..</p>
<p>First let's make the tag look nice, we can change the display in inline (now we know that display/position are different) and rounded those corners a bit. </p>
<img src="../images/css-tag-refresh-all.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>and here are the results:</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<h3>Relative</h3>
<p>The relative position is named as such because the position is relative to its normal self. You can offset a position by adjusting the  the top, bottom, left, and right properties.</p>
<p>Let's try it out!</p>
<img src="../images/css-relative-position.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Seems to do the trick!</p>
<img src="../images/relative-results.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>But now let's say I want to change the width of the parent object (blog-box) from 400px to 800px. </p>
<img src="../images/css-blog-blox-400px.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<img src="../images/css-blog-blox-800px.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">
<p>Here's what it looks like.</p>
<img src="../images/blog-box-800px.png" alt="screenshot of flexbox use on blogs on desktop" class="image-resize-small">

<p>That’s not good. Seems like the relative position might need to be adjusted every time which is not ideal. Time to try something else.  </p>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Absolute</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>To recap</h3>

<p>These are the things we've learnt together:</p>
<ul>
  <li>learnt the difference bwtween display and position properties</li>
  <li>looked at the differences between fixed, relative and abolute positions</li>
  <li>found a solution to our problem using abolute positions</li>
</ul>
