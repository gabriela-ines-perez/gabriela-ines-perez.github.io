    <h3>The Malleable Brain</h3>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is a relatively recent discovery that has overturned the long-held belief among scientists that our brain structure and ability are fixed, and that intelligence is innate. In fact, our brains have a remarkable ability to change and adapt through creating new pathways, known as neuroplasticity. There are two types of neuroplasticity: functional plasticity, which involves the brain's ability to move functions from a damaged area of the brain to other undamaged areas, and structural plasticity, which involves the brain's ability to change its physical structure due to learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most powerful takeaways from understanding neuroplasticity is how we form habits. Habits are critical to our growth and consistency, but they can be difficult to establish. For example, as someone with ADHD, I've found that my attention is best when there's external stimuli from novelty, competition, urgency, or reward. But not everything in life offers these stimuli, so it's important to build habits.
    </p>
    <h3>Going from fixed to growth</h3>
    <p>
      The shift from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset is essential in cultivating habits. I realized that I had developed a fixed mindset in some areas of my life, and I set out to change that. Mindset types can vary depending on what we're focusing on; for example, we may have a fixed mindset towards exercise but a growth mindset towards learning a new skill.


    </p>
    It's interesting to see how my mindset was shaped by the systems I was in, which valued immediate results over long-term growth. The pressure to achieve high marks and avoid being left behind was immense, leading to a culture of cheating and other negative behaviors that are often rewarded in later life. We need to remember that the purpose of learning is not just to get good grades, but to better understand how we learn and grow. By embracing neuroplasticity and a growth mindset, we can cultivate habits that help us achieve our goals and become the best version of ourselves.
