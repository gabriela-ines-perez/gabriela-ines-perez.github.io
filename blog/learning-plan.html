  <h3 class="subheading-blog"><strong>Bootcamp Learning Plan</strong> </h3>
  <h3>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
  <p>
    I am keen to see other applications outside of just web development. Keen to make things that solve real-world problems and join good teams with shared values and high ambition. I would like to explore other languages as well maybe try to look at animation, game development and robotics (if just in my free time then that works for me). Could be my ADHD brain but I am excited to try it all!
  </p>
  <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
  <p>
    I think a limitation I would like to add is understanding my hang-ups around learning and aiming for a more growth mindset. I was a bit more caught up with comparing myself to others than I would have liked to be. I think I am feeling good at my ability to manage stress and problem solve and learn things fairly quickly and I think these will all be strengths during bootcamp!
  </p>
  <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
  <p>
    Just getting out of my own way- not getting too distracted by external life things and trying to really commit all my time and focus to the course (as much as reasonable). Finding time for exercise and friends might be a challenge. 
  </p>
  <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
  <p>
    Building a growth mindset. Building good habits and working well with teams. I would also like to be a better listener. I found that I was not as good as I thought I was in the listening and looping exercises. 
  </p>
  <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
  <p>
    I would want us to all remain curious and remember we are here to learn and we should all trust the process. I expect others to also value good communication- from what I have seen in the discord, I have full faith that we will have a very welcoming and helpful cohort. 
  </p>
  <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
  <p>
    I want to trust the process and make time for things that are good for my mental health.
  </p>

  <h3 class="subheading-blog"><strong>Foundations Learning Plan</strong> </h3>
  <h3>Building a career at Dev Academy</h3>
  <p>
    Over the months leading up to Dev Academy, I found myself unsure of what I wanted to do with my career. I’ve always just gone with the wind and did whatever opportunity was right in front of me and what I found exciting. I am very curious and social so I’ve done some exciting things in my life. Recently, I found myself unhappy with my day-to-day (despite loving the organisations I was working for) and I knew that I wanted to do something hands-on. I also had a yearning to learn something new. I knew that I wanted to build things. Things that are useful for society and that can solve problems. I saw my career follow a management trajectory (maybe project management or creative directing) and that wasn’t sitting right- I wanted to be part of a technical team. I am good at problem-solving, am creative, and enjoy taking risks. I am not good at doing a formulaic and repetitive desk job. I am good at leading a team but I enjoy being a team member more. I don’t have the focus for deep research or long bits of writing or admin-heavy jobs. I am a broad-strokes type of person, I don’t get stuck into details in a healthy way. I work well with people who are more details oriented. I would like to improve how I work in teams, take criticism and communicate with those who depend on me. I want to be more realistic about what I can do and step aside when I know I have to let someone else take over. 
  </p>
  <h3>Managing my workload</h3>    
<p>
  To manage myself I need to TRUST THE PROCESS, not get too far ahead of myself and not compare myself to others. I need to listen to my body, take breaks when needed, and not overextend myself and risk burnout. I want to sit with things and let them settle- not move on too quickly to the next shiny thing if I have time to be a little more mindful. I need to take care of my body. Eat well, sleep and exercise. That is the only way I can get through. I will ask for help and not get left behind. I commit to not letting things stack up and overwhelm me. I will communicate with my team and find a way to stay on top of things.
</p>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>
  I need to work to my rhythms, I need to be able to be flexible in my working hours so I can manage my ADHD and be present in my life outside the course. I will need time in nature and need to prioritise my mental health all the time. I think the course is already set up to allow people like me to thrive. So I already feel like this is an excellent fit.
