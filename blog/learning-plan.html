  <h3>Building a career at Dev Academy</h3>
  <p>Over the months leading up to Dev Academy, I found myself unsure of what I wanted to do with my career. I’ve always just gone with the wind and did whatever opportunity was right in front of me and what I found exciting. I am very curious and social so I’ve done some exciting things in my life. Recently, I found myself unhappy with my day-to-day (despite loving the organisations I was working for) and I knew that I wanted to do something hands-on. I also had a yearning to learn something new. I knew that I wanted to build things. Things that are useful for society and that can solve problems. I saw my career follow a management trajectory (maybe project management or creative directing) and that wasn’t sitting right- I wanted to be part of a technical team. I am good at problem-solving, am creative, and enjoy taking risks. I am not good at doing a formulaic and repetitive desk job. I am good at leading a team but I enjoy being a team member more. I don’t have the focus for deep research or long bits of writing or admin-heavy jobs. I am a broad-strokes type of person, I don’t get stuck into details in a healthy way. I work well with people who are more details oriented. I would like to improve how I work in teams, take criticism and communicate with those who depend on me. I want to be more realistic about what I can do and step aside when I know I have to let someone else take over. </p>
  <h3>Managing my workload</h3>    
<p>To manage myself I need to TRUST THE PROCESS, not get too far ahead of myself and not compare myself to others. I need to listen to my body, take breaks when needed, and not overextend myself and risk burnout. I want to sit with things and let them settle- not move on too quickly to the next shiny thing if I have time to be a little more mindful. I need to take care of my body. Eat well, sleep and exercise. That is the only way I can get through. I will ask for help and not get left behind. I commit to not letting things stack up and overwhelm me. I will communicate with my team and find a way to stay on top of things.</p>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>I need to work to my rhythms, I need to be able to be flexible in my working hours so I can manage my ADHD and be present in my life outside the course. I will need time in nature and need to prioritise my mental health all the time. I think the course is already set up to allow people like me to thrive. So I already feel like this is an excellent fit. </p>
