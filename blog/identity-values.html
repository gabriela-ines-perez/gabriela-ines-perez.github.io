      <h3>Values shaped by neurodiversity. This unpacks how I think my ADHD is a superpower and how it's made me more empathetic.</em></h3>

  <div id="blog-text">
  <ol>
    <li><h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3></li>
    <p>I had to give a hard personal critique to someone I deeply care about and respect. I knew that it might hurt our relationship and their opinion of me. This is someone I look up to and would want to work with again. A selfish part of me wanted to keep it to myself to spare the relationship but I knew if I didn’t say anything I would not be helping them. I was also afraid that in giving criticism I was opening myself up to receive criticism. I decided to bite the bullet and I did it. All my fears eventuated and I received harsh feedback in return. It and it was awkward and hard but I think we have both grown and it has also helped the people around us who were struggling with the issues we addressed. Our relationship is stronger and time has proven that, once again, open and honest communication is essential for thriving relationships.</p>
    <li><h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3></li>
    <p>I owe a lot of my worldview to the friends I’ve made and the incredible humans I have lived with over the years. My personality is thanks to my family- who are loud, energetic, and curious. There’s nothing we can’t laugh at. They have shaped my sense of humour and my need to enjoy life to the fullest. They provide a touchstone for love and acceptance in my life. My friends have made me more empathetic, as has my journey through my own battles with mental health. My friends are a bit more serious than me, they care about politics, and the environment and have taught me to also care about those things and to always have the most vulnerable person in mind when making decisions. I owe who I am to the community around me.</p>
    <li><h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3></li>
    <p>I am good at leading a team, being empathetic and keeping a cool head. I like to think that I keep up morale, and I have the capacity to pick up the slack if it’s needed. I love problem-solving and enjoy being creative. I intend to lean on this to keep me sane during this course and allow me to be an asset to a team.</p>
    <li><h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3></li>
    <p>I have been greatly affected by my mental health over the years, having struggled to finish things I started and having been continuously let down the education and health system. I have worked hard over the years to overcome this. I have built a career in science communication and led a software startup despite not having a degree. I know my ADHD gets in the way- but I tend to think of it as a superpower and instead of constantly trying to work against it- I’ve decided to go with it. I let it lead the way in terms of what I say yes to and what I choose to pursue.</p>
    <li><h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why?</h3></li>
    <p>One of the hardest things was trying to get a technical team to adopt a new suite of tools I had built for them to make their lives easier. There was resistance to change, disagreement with my choices and different levels of uptake. It was a mess. I learnt a valuable lesson in building something alongside the people who will use it, letting a team tell you what they need. I learnt about the importance of letting people take ownership of decisions made and the processes created- instead of forcing one on them. Without ownership, there is no buy-in, regardless of how good the new system is. </p>
